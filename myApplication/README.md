Architecture: AngularJS is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, whereas Angular uses a component-based architecture.

Language: AngularJS uses JavaScript, while Angular uses TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript adds static typing and other features to JavaScript to make it more scalable and maintainable.

Performance: Angular offers better performance compared to AngularJS
services,directives, pipes , lazy loading, data transmision techniques in angular are more popular and easy to use

use/feature of angular:
Angular is a popular open-source framework for building web applications. Here are some of the primary uses and advantages of Angular:

Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Angular is well-suited for developing single-page applications where the entire content is dynamically updated without requiring a full page reload. It provides tools and features for building responsive, fast, and interactive web applications.

Data Binding: Angular offers powerful two-way data binding, which allows automatic synchronization of data between the model (data) and the view (UI). This simplifies the development process and reduces the amount of code needed to manage data updates.

Modular Development: Angular promotes a modular approach to application development. It uses components as building blocks, which are self-contained units that encapsulate the UI and behavior. This modularity improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

Dependency Injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection (DI) system that makes it easier to manage and inject dependencies into different components and services. DI improves code testability, flexibility, and scalability.

Routing: Angular provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows developers to navigate between views and define different routes within their application. This makes it easy to create multi-page-like experiences in a single-page application.

Testing: Angular has excellent support for testing, including unit testing and end-to-end testing. It provides tools and utilities that facilitate writing testable code and running tests to ensure application quality and stability.

what is component ?
In Angular, a component is a fundamental building block used to create the user interface (UI) of an application. 
Each component consists of three main parts:
Template: The template defines the structure and layout of the component's UI. It is written in HTML and can include Angular-specific syntax and directives to bind data, handle events, and perform other dynamic operations.

Class: The class represents the component's behavior and state. It is written in TypeScript and contains properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks that define how the component behaves. 

Metadata: The metadata is defined using a decorator (@Component) in Angular. It provides additional information about the component
